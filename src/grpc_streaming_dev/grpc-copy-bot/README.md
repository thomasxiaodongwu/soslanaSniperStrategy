# *Geyser gRPC Copy Bot (Beta)*

## Overview

A copy trading bot uses gRPC to stream target trader's swap txns. It's designed to quickly detect and trade the target trader's Raydium swap txns.

## How it works

- It uses the geyser grpc plugin that subscribe all the latest slot that receive from the grpc server.
- It basically only consider the slot or block in "processed" commitment level to make sure the request can land in the next block or next few block(what we expected).

- Use a grpc subscription to subscribe the transactions that including the target smart wallet address and listen for the swap transactions.
- Once the swap event is detected, it calculate the how much token the trader bought or how much token the trader sold by considering the number of token and sol changes in the liquidity pool, and it follows the exact swapped token amount of the trader.
- The entry/exit price is calculated by the formula: entry/exit price = post SOL in Pool / post token in Pool.

## Limitations
- It only works on raydium swap transactions now.
- It uses WSOL.

## Prerequisites

- run `ts-node src/streaming/copy-trade.ts -h` to test the copy-trade command and see the available options
- to change the parameters, you can modify the .env file
- to have a try, run ```ts-node /Users/{your_path_to_this_dir}/src/streaming/copy-trade.ts --trader your_target_trader_address```

## Code usage

- constants/constants.ts: retriving the variable in .env

- src/streaming/copy-trade.ts: a cli interface to interact the whole dir

- streaming/stream-trader.ts: subscribing any trader's swap txns of newest block in processed level

- src/jito/bundle.ts: sending the bundle with tips to jito

- src/streaming/grpc-requests-type.ts: different grpc request types for monitoring the target trader

- src/raydium/*.ts: constructing the proper instructions of buy and sell on raydium

## Features

- streaming of trader's swap txns
- copy the swap txns and we swap it on raydium in milliseconds
- the entry/exit price of the trader's swap is calculated by the formula: entry/exit price = post SOL in Pool / post token in Pool
- Integration with Jito leader schedule (optional)
- Customizable logging with Pino
